# Echo Chamber

In an era where music unites all, it's fitting to create a single page app that can encourage users to select a room, chat with strangers alike and share each others favourite music.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Express
- Postgres
- Prisma
- SocketIO

## Challenges

This was our first major project working within a group environment so that alone came with a heap of challenges.

Firstly, early on it was clear that we would have a hard time being on the same page all the time. While we are all competent developers, it was more about **how** we can be aligned. As time moved on, we were able to have a much better idea on what the project was positioned to be.

**SocketIO**

This was our first time implementing SocketIO in a more complex project outside of a simple chat feature. A lot of bugs had appeared that took a lot of our time away

## Things we did well

## TODO

**Joel**

- Add room information above the chatbox (roomname, connected users etc)
- Allow users to change their alias
- Broadcast when a user connects to a room
- Add rooms dynamically if the user chooses to
